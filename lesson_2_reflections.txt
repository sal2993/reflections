What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When you initialize a repository git creates the meta data you will need to
  make commits. It needs to be done because without 'git init' you wont have 
  the power of git.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository
  because all it does is hold the files that will soon be made into a commit.
  The value it offers is that you do not have to add all of the files in your
  working directory to a commit.
